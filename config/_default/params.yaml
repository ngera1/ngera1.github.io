projects:
  - title: "Creating a new statistical test for racial bias"
    collaborator: "Prof. [Emma Pierson](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~emmapierson/)"
    description: "We developed a new test for racial bias using perceived race and multiple observations of the same person. Tests for racial bias typically compare different individuals, making it hard to isolate race as the cause of different treatment. Perceived identity traits, like race, can vary per interaction, so our approach examines whether a person is treated differently depending on their perceived race. Applying this to police traffic stops across three states, we find drivers perceived as Hispanic are more likely to be searched or arrested than when perceived as white. Beyond assessing racial bias, this test can apply to other perceived-identity analyses. Paper [published in Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx5829) and highlighted in the [Cornell Spotlight](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/spotlights/student-spotlight-nora-gera/)."
