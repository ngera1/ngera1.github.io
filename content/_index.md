Hi! I'm Nora, a second-year CS PhD student at Cornell University. When I started Cornell as a 15-year-old undergrad, I immediately felt a connection to the way we build machine systems that interact with the world, and I’ve been working in this area ever since. 

My research interests include improving AI/ML algorithms, through the lens of performance, fairness, and interpretability. Specifically, I'm interested in studying LLM-based mechanisms of automation and the implications on robustness and performance.


Before graduate school, I worked for two years as a full-stack developer at Microsoft after graduating from Cornell with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science + minor in Biomedical Engineering.

My hobbies include reading and playing violin (click ✨ for details!).
